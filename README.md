###Overview

The aim of the project was to intergrate the skills we have learned into one project.

* Included separate HTML/CSS/Javascript files
* To have a working game built by myself
* To host a working game with a link from my Github repo

###Technology used

* Javascript
* jQuery
* HTML5
* CSS3
* heroku
* git

###Evaluation

Challenging project utilsing the skills I had learnt in the first two weeks of the course. It taught me a lot about overcoming obsticles from a blank project all the way from start to finish.


###Process

Concieved the idea from similar games like 'track and field' and 'BBC Denise Lewis Heptathalon. Used wireframing to design basic structure. Simple tests of moving divs across the screen. Once achieved styling was added to give the game a retro feel, with a bit of comedy attached.

###Challenges
* Main challenges faced were making sure that the key press of either 'z and x' or '< and>' had to be in sequence to ensure that you could not just tap one key. This was over come by setting a variable of last key to ensure the sequential key press was true before moveing across the screen.
* Another challenge was to stop both sprites from moving once the race had finished. This was achieved by adding a variable of raceInProgress which was either true or false in order to diable the moving process.

###What Next?

* Would have liked to add move events such as a hurdeling event. But looking into this showed that handing collisions would have proved difficult at this stage. So perhaps something to build on in the future.
